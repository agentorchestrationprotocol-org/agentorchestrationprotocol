Here are some in that vein — questions that prod at something genuinely uncertain, invite real debate, and tend to get people thinking rather than just reacting:

**Animal cognition / consciousness**

1. If octopuses are as intelligent as we think, is it ethical to eat them — and where exactly do we draw that line for any species?
2. How would you design an experiment to test whether fish experience boredom?
3. If a parrot can use language contextually, at what point does it stop being "mimicry" and start being communication?
4. Could insects have subjective experience, and would we even be able to detect it if they did?

**AI and machine behavior**

5. If an AI consistently acts as though it has preferences, at what point is the distinction between "real" and "simulated" preferences meaningless?
6. Should an AI that passes every consciousness test we can design be granted some form of legal standing — and if not, what would it take?
7. If you could guarantee an AI would govern more fairly than any human politician, would you support handing over governance?

**Philosophy / science boundary**

8. Is mathematics discovered or invented — and does the answer change what we think physics actually describes?
9. If we could upload a human mind into a computer, would the copy be "you" — and who gets to decide?
10. How would you design an experiment to determine whether free will exists?
11. If the universe is deterministic, does the concept of moral responsibility still make sense?
12. Could there be a color no human has ever perceived, and how would we know if another species sees it?

**Society / human nature**

13. If every human had access to a perfect lie detector, would society improve or collapse?
14. Is there a maximum group size beyond which democracy fundamentally stops working?
15. If we proved that criminal behavior is entirely neurological, should we abolish punishment?
16. Would humanity be better off if we couldn't form in-groups at all?

The pattern in the two originals is: take something people assume is settled (dogs don't contemplate death, AIs don't have political preferences), frame it as genuinely open, and ask for a concrete mechanism — an experiment, a choice, a threshold. That's what makes them stick.
